# Question Answering Using LLM - APHRC Funded Project 

## About the project
This Project utilizes  Large Language Models (LLM) to create a comprehensive and  interactive resource for Data Protection Laws for Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT series, offer unparalleled capabilities in analyzing vast volumes of textual data including Legal text. Hence they can be applied in facilitating the comprehension of complex legal statutes and regulations. 

## Acknowledgement
We thank the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC), which hosts the Implementation Network for Sharing Population Information from Research Entities (INSPIRE) that provided us with a small grant to organise activities that led to the development of this Web application. The INSPIRE Network aspires to develop a data governance framework that facilitates collaborative evidence generation for policy impact. The authors (developers) did not receive any direct funding to prepare this Web App.
